        <h1>Documentation</h1>
        <h3><a href="validate.html">Plugin #1 - Validation</a></h3>
        <p>This plugin is used to make sure everything entered into a form is entered correctly.
        On the linked page above, you will see a form to fill out.
        If anything is filled incorrectly, the plugin will be used to generate an error message near the incorrectly filled control.</p>

        <h3><a href="fittext.html">Plugin #2 - FitText</a></h3>
        <p>The FitText plugin is used for dynamically changing text size based on the window's size, and is primarily designed to make responsive websites easier to design.
        In this example of the plugin, the text size is set when the page loads, but there's also a slider that changes a parameter in order to see the plugin in action.</p>

        <h3><a href="twentytwenty.html">Plugin #3 - TwentyTwenty</a></h3>
        <p>The TwentyTwenty plugin is used to have two pictures overlap each other and be able to transition from one to the other in the same container.
        Within this page, there are two sets of pictures showing an example of a horizontal and vertical transition.</p>

        <h3><a href="tabs.html">Tabs</a></h3>
        <p>The tabs page showcases a way to group several pieces of content into one area by splitting it into different tabs.
        When one of the tab headings is clicked on, the content held within it will appear in place of the old content.</p>

        <h3><a href="json.html">JSON</a></h3>
        <p>In the JSON page, all of the content is loaded in using a JSON file.
        If Javascript is disabled, the only thing that would appear is the error message saying Javascript needs to be enabled in order to use the website.</p>

        <h3><a href="ajax.html">AJAX</a></h3>
        <p>The AJAX page is similar to the JSON page in that all the content is loaded from separate files.
        Unlike the JSON page, a single function was able to be built to bring in each piece of content, since we didn't need any rules on how to parse the data.</p>

        <h3><a href="map.html">Map</a></h3>
        <p>The map page asks the user for permission to use their location. If they accept, then a map is generated centered on their location.</p>
