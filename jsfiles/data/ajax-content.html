<h1>AJAX Page</h1>
<p>
  Just like the JSON page, everything here was loaded using AJAX.
  If Javascript was disabled all you would see is an error message at the top of the page saying to enable Javascript.
  Unlike JSON, though, since the data doesn't have to be parsed in a specific way, the Javascript for this page has a function that simply loads each section of AJAX data.
